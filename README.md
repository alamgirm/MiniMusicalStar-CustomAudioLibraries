This is a custom audio library written with Core Audio for iOS 4.3 and above. It was part of a larger iPad "karaoke-style" app, done for my client as my Final Year Project in school. This library enables the simultaneous playback of multiple streams from audio (mp3, m4a, etc) files as well as recording in real-time from the iOS device's microphone, while playback is happening. 

Please refer to MixPlayerRecorder.h for usage instructions.
